This Project was an assignment and its purpose to show a set of filters given by API request, but I stored it locally as they asked.

I used Redux Toolkit as a storage management tool to enhance the performance and to make life easier for pages and components

I've created several testing files and covered 9 tests to make sure that it works perfectly
